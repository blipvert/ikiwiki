(brief, sorry, via Phone. More details to follow)

I  gradually splitting discussion pages into separate comment pages, containing a comment directive.

The "date" attribute is being set to the date output by gig for a commit. (I'd hope this was parseable)

The presentation of the resulting comments is not sorted by this date, which I would hope/expect, but instead by the ctime or mtime of the file at the other end, as best I can tell.

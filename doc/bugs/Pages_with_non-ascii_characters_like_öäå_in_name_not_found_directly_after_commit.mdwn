At least my setup on kapsi.fi always prints 404 Not Found after adding a page with non-ascii characters in name. But the page exists and is visible after the 404 with url encoding and the blog page is inlined correctly on the feed page.

Apparently ikiwiki.info does not complain with 404. Should the character encoding be set in wiki config?

Happens also after editing the page. Here's an example:

 * page name displayed in 404: http://mcfrisk.kapsi.fi/skiing/posts/Iso-Sy%F6te%20Freeride%202011%20Teaser.html?updated
 * page name in the blog feed: http://mcfrisk.kapsi.fi/skiing/posts/Iso-Sy%C3%B6te%20Freeride%202011%20Teaser.html

Difference is in the word Iso-Sy√∂te. Pehaps also the browsers is part of the game, I use Iceweasel from Debian unstable with default settings.

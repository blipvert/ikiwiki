After deleting a page with the "remove" button, it seems that the page deletion cannot be reverted using the "revert" icon in [[RecentChanges]]. 
It ironically says that "Error: ?$pagename does not exist". See [[http://ikiwiki.info/ikiwiki.cgi?rev=860c2c84d98ea0a38a4f91dacef6d4e09f6e6c2e&do=revert]]. [[JeanPrivat]]

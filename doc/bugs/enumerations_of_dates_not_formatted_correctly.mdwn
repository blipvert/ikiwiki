When an enumeration contains entries starting with ordinal numbers, e.g., for lists of meeting dates, ikiwiki turns them all into the 1st.

Testcase:

*The following lists should read: 1. January, 27. March, 99. November, 42. April*
**But instead it reads:**

* 1. January
* 27. March
* 99. November
* 42. April

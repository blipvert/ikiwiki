     registration. Closes: #[601912](http://bugs.debian.org/601912)

   * Fix htmlscrubber\_skip to be matched on the source page, not the page it is
     inlined into. Should allow setting to "* and !comment(*)" to scrub
     comments, but leave your blog posts unscrubbed, etc.
   * comments: Make postcomment() pagespec work when previewing a comment,
     including during moderation.
   * comments: Make comment() pagespec also match comments that are being
     posted."""]]

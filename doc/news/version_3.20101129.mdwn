   * websetup: Fix encoding problem when restoring old setup file.
   * more: Add pages parameter to limit where the more is displayed.
     (thanks, dark)
   * Fix escaping of filenames in historyurl. (Thanks, aj)
   * inline: Improve RSS url munging to use a proper html parser,
     and support all elements that HTML::Tagset knows about.
     (Which doesn't include html5 just yet, but then the old version
     didn't either.) Bonus: 4 times faster than old regexp method.
   * Optimise glob() pagespec. (Thanks, Kathryn and smcv)
   * highlight: Support new format of filetypes.conf used by version 3.2
     of the highlight package.
   * edittemplate: Fix crash if using a .tmpl file or other non-page file
     as a template for a new page.
   * git: Fix temp file location.
   * rename: Fix to pass named parameters to rcs\_commit.
   * git: Avoid adding files when committing, so as not to implicitly add
     files like recentchanges files that are not normally checked in,
     when fixing links after rename."""]]

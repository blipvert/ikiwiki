   * editpage: Avoid inheriting internal page types.
   * htmltidy: Avoid breaking the sidebar when websetup is running.
   * transient: New utility plugin that allows transient pages to
     be stored in .ikiwiki/transient/ (smcv)
   * aggregate: Aggregated content is stored in the transient underlay.
     (Existing aggregated content is not moved, since it will eventually
     expire and be removed) (smcv)
   * autoindex, tag: Added autoindex\_commit and tag\_autocreate\_commit that
     can be unset to make index files and tags respectively not be committed,
     and instead be stored in the transient underlay.
     Closes: #[544322](http://bugs.debian.org/544322) (smcv)
   * autoindex: Adapted to use add\_autofile. Slight behavior changes
     in edge cases that are probably really bug fixes. (smcv)
   * recentchanges: Use transient underlay (smcv)
   * map: Avoid unnecessary ul's in maps with nested directories.
     (Giuseppe Bilotta)

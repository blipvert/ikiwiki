The theme plugin allows easily applying a theme to your wiki, by
configuring the `theme` setting in the setup file with the name of a theme
to use. The themes you can choose from are all subdirectories, typically
inside `/usr/share/ikiwiki/themes/`. See [[themes]] for an overview
of the themes included in ikiwiki.

You can set the theme via the **theme** option in your config file (after
enabling the plugin). Refresh the wiki after changing it to see the changes.

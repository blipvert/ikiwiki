Some time ago there was a [[question|http://ikiwiki.info/forum/how_to_get_nice_pdf_from_ikiwiki_pages__63__/?updated#comment-05381634f89629ad26298a1af4b1d5f9]] in the forum how to get a nice pdf output from an ikiwiki page. However there were no answers. So I put it on the todo list, because I think this would be a nice feature.

Note that for example dokuwiki has a [[nice plugin|http://danjer.doudouke.org/tech/dokutexit]] which converts the wiki page to latex and then to pdf and you can customize the latex-preamble.

`add_autofile` could be adapted to do this, or a similar API could be
added.

This would also be useful for autoindex, as suggested on
[[plugins/autoindex/discussion]]. I'd also like to use it for
[[plugins/contrib/album]].

One refinement I'd suggest is that if the transient page is edited,
its transient contents are evaluated and used as the initial
content for the edit box; after that, it'd become a static page. --[[smcv]]

[[!tag patch]]

I had a look at implementing this. It turns out to be harder than I thought
to have purely in-memory pages (several plugins want to be able to access the
source file as a file), but I did get this proof-of-concept branch
to write tag and autoindex pages into an underlay.

This loses the ability to delete the auto-created pages (although they don't
clutter up git this way, at least), and a lot of the code in autoindex is
probably now redundant, so this is probably not quite ready for merge, but
I'd welcome opinions.

Usage: set `tag_underlay` and/or `autoindex_underlay` to an absolute path,
which you must create beforehand. I suggest *srcdir* + `/.ikiwiki/transient`.

Refinements that could be made if this approach seems reasonable:

* make these options boolean, and have the path always be `.ikiwiki/transient`
* improve the `remove` plugin so it also deletes from this special underlay

>> Or to make it more flexible, have just one option "transient_underlay" which is set to an absolute path, and if it is set, then one is using a transient-underlay.

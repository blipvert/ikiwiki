A tag for patches that I would merge if I had commit access to ikiwiki,
in the hope that it's a useful shortlist for committers to look at.
They're mirrored in my git repository under the `ready/*` namespace.

[[!inline pages="(todo/* or bugs/*) and link(patch) and !link(bugs/done) and
   !link(todo/done) and link(users/smcv/yesplease) and !*/Discussion"
   archive="yes"]]
